**Micromouse Maze Building/Solving algorithm:**
  This program generates a randomized maze each time it is ran, then using the randomized maze, solves the maze in a series of steps 
  using only the information provided in the cells that have already been visited. The logic for the movements is dependent on the cells 
  pythagorean distance from the center cells (i.e when presented with an opportunity to move up, or right it will choose the cell with 
  the closest distance to the center, provided the cell has not already been explored.). In the case where the selected cell leads down
  a dead-end path it will incrementally backtrack to the last cell that had an unvisited neighbor cell that had not been selected, and 
  continue steps down that unexplored path. The steps will continue until it has reached the targeted cell, upon which the program will 
  re-run using the same maze and with the knowledge from the last run will sovle the maze in fewer steps, provided some of the steps that
  it took to get to the center in the subsequent run were less-efficient paths that required backtracking.
