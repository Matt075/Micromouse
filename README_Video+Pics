**Brief Explanation**
VIDEO:
- Moves cell to cell till it reaches one of the four-grouped middle cells. 
        **(Only has knowledge of visited,  and adjacent cells)**
- Moves roughly based on Pythagorean distance to center cells
- 'X's denote moves along dead end paths that algorithm chose at first
        the big number change at 23->43 in video represents number of moves algorithm
        takes to explore, and backtrack from dead end path
- Repeats same maze twice, in the second run it utilizes knowledge form first run
        in order to take more efficient route. 

PCITURES:
All 3 pictures feature the same maze at different steps of execution.
